Foundation models — the large, general-purpose neural networks that power chat assistants and AI overviews — aren’t just another ranking algorithm. They evaluate and surface content according to an internal hierarchy that looks nothing like classic web search. And that’s important: recent, large-scale analyses and industry reports show that the signals that make a site authoritative on the web are largely orthogonal to the signals these models use to decide what to cite and surface in AI answers.\n\nIn April 2025, an analysis of 41 million AI search results across platforms like ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and Copilot showed a near-total disconnect between traditional SEO metrics and AI citation behavior — 95% of citation variance couldn’t be explained by traffic metrics (r² = 0.05), and 97.2% couldn’t be explained by backlink profiles (r² = 0.038) [1]. In plain English: domain authority, backlink counts, and even raw traffic aren’t the primary features these models use to decide what to quote.\n\nAt the same time, foundation models have undergone rapid convergence and efficiency gains. Stanford’s AI Index (April 2025) and companion reports show that top models’ performance gaps shrank dramatically, smaller models matched larger predecessors on core benchmarks, and costs to query large models collapsed within months — all of which change how search and answer systems are built and which content gets surfaced [2][3][5].\n\nThis post is a technical, practical tour through the neural network hierarchy that governs AI search visibility. We’ll unpack the model-level mechanics, the empirical signals that matter, how to adapt content strategies for AI-driven result surfaces, and the strategic implications for anyone trying to rank in LLM results. Expect specific numbers and dates from the April–June 2025 research window and clear, actionable takeaways you can try on your next content iteration.\n\n## Understanding the Neural Network Hierarchy\n\nWhat do we mean by “neural network hierarchy”? At a high level, it’s the set of learned representations, intermediate modules, and decision layers inside a foundation model (and the surrounding ranking systems) that together decide which text spans, documents, or sources are relevant and reliable enough to appear in an AI-generated answer.\n\nClassic search has two broad phases: crawling/indexing and ranking (relevance + authority signals like links, clicks, dwell time). Foundation-model-based systems add—and often replace—those phases with learned retrieval, grounding, and answer-generation steps:\n\n- Representation: Text is turned into dense vectors by the model’s encoder. These embeddings capture semantic meaning and content features the model was trained to value (factuality, explicitness, structure).\n- Retrieval: Vector search (often approximate nearest neighbor) surfaces candidate documents or passages based on embedding similarity rather than link-based authority.\n- Reranking / Fusion: Scored candidates are re-evaluated by the model itself in context; the model weighs freshness, explicitness of answers, and internal confidence when deciding what to cite or include.\n- Generation / Citation: The model constructs a response and decides whether to cite an external source, often based on whether the retrieved passage can be integrated without hallucination.\n\nWhy does this lead to different outcomes? Because embeddings and learned scoring prioritize patterns directly tied to the training objectives: clarity of answerable statements, explicit extraction of facts, recency signals learned from usage, and the model’s internal uncertainty estimates. These are not equivalent to “many incoming links” or “high traffic.” In practice, the April 2025 analysis of 41 million AI search results concluded that the vast majority of citation behavior is unexplained by traffic and backlink metrics, indicating these learned features are dominant drivers [1].\n\nA few supporting trends from industry reports clarify the context:\n- Model performance convergence: Between 2023 and early 2025 the performance differences among top models shrank substantially (Elo score gap between top and 10th fell from 11.9% to 5.4%; gap between the top two fell from 4.9% to 0.7%) — which makes retrieval and grounding mechanisms more decisive when differentiating outputs [3].\n- Efficiency and cost drops: Small models now match older large ones on many benchmarks (e.g., PaLM was 540B in 2022 vs. Phi-3-mini at 3.8B in 2024 for >60% MMLU), and query costs decreased from roughly $20 per million tokens in Nov 2022 to $0.07 per million tokens by Oct 2024 with Gemini-1.5-Flash-8B — a 280x cost reduction [2]. Cheaper inference means broader deployment of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and frequent re-indexing, increasing the importance of recency.\n- Industry dynamics: Industry models account for ~90% of prominent models in 2024 (up from 60% in 2023), which concentrates engineering practices and encourages aggressive retraining, refresh cadence, and production-grade grounding [4].\n\nTaken together, the hierarchy is less about superficial popularity and more about the match between what your content actually says (and how it’s structured) and what the model has learned to trust as an answerable, up-to-date, and mappable piece of text.\n\n## Key Components and Analysis\n\nLet’s break down the technical components driving ranking in LLM/AI search systems, together with the empirical evidence from the research windows (April–June 2025).\n\n1. Embeddings and Semantic Match\n   - How it works: Content gets converted to dense vectors. Semantic similarity is computed between the query vector and stored document vectors.\n   - Why it matters: Embeddings capture paraphrases, synonyms, and context better than keyword matching. If your page contains concise, extractable answers, it will map more closely in embedding space.\n   - Evidence: The 41M-result analysis found AI citations aligned strongly with content features not tied to traffic or backlinks — consistent with embedding-driven retrieval [1].\n\n2. Freshness and Re-index Frequency\n   - How it works: Many AI search systems refresh their document stores on the scale of days (not months) and weight publication/update time within reranking.\n   - Why it matters: Models prefer recent sources for time-sensitive queries. Doing a major content update can yield citations quickly.\n   - Evidence: The same large-scale analysis noted model preference for content freshness at the timescale of days; the decline in query cost and model efficiency enables frequent re-indexing [1][2].\n\n3. Explicitness and Extractability\n   - How it works: Models favor text with explicit statements, clear answer spans (e.g., bullet lists, short declarative sentences), and machine-readable structure (schema, headings).\n   - Why it matters: During retrieval and fusion, passages that provide compact, verifiable facts are easier to use and cite with confidence.\n   - Practical result: Pages with structured, answer-oriented sections are more likely to be chosen as evidence in a generated response.\n\n4. Confidence Estimation and Reranking\n   - How it works: The model internally estimates uncertainty and uses that to weigh candidates. Reranking networks or rescoring modules can demote ambiguous passages.\n   - Why it matters: Even a correct page can be ignored if the model’s internal confidence in extracting a claim is low. Explicit context (e.g., definitions, citations within the page) helps.\n   - Evidence: Convergence of models and prevalence of RAG approaches mean these rescoring steps have outsized impact on final citations [3].\n\n5. Data Lineage & Forking Practices\n   - How it works: Modern training involves checkpoint forking—branching experiments from checkpoints, data slices, and curated datasets to preserve lineage and enable backtracking.\n   - Why it matters: These practices impact which training data impressions a model encodes and which content patterns it learns to favor. Being present in the training slices that inform a deployed checkpoint increases the chance of being used as ground truth.\n   - Evidence: Reports show teams increasingly use forking strategies to maintain experimental history and to control which sources influence production behavior [5].\n\n6. Domain Agnostic vs Domain Specific Signals\n   - How it works: Some LLM-based systems add domain-specific rerankers (legal, medical). These rerankers inject domain priors (regulatory trust, speciality signals).\n   - Why it matters: If your audience is niche, being cited requires meeting domain-specific quality markers in addition to generic clarity and freshness.\n\n7. The Decline of Backlink Dominance\n   - Evidence: The inverse or weak relationship between backlinks and AI citations in the 41M sample suggests that strong link graphs are not predictive of being surfaced, and sites with fewer backlinks sometimes receive more citations [1]. In short: link building alone won’t guarantee AI visibility.\n\nTogether, these components create a layered decision pipeline: embedding similarity generates candidates, reranking and confidence models score them, freshness and extractability influence acceptance, and final generation decides whether to attribute. The strongest single lesson from the empirical analysis is that most variance in AI citation behavior is explained by internal representation and retrieval factors rather than traditional SEO metrics.\n\n## Practical Applications\n\nIf you’re trying to rank for AI/LLM results — to be cited in answers, to be surfaced by assistants, or to appear in overview snippets — here are concrete, actionable strategies aligned to the neural network hierarchy.\n\n1. Structure content for extractability\n   - Action: Add succinct, declarative answer blocks (1–3 sentence summaries), numbered steps, and short FAQs at the top of pages. Use headings that clearly denote the question and answer.\n   - Rationale: Embedding-based retrieval and answer fusion prefer short, high-density answer spans.\n\n2. Treat freshness as a feature\n   - Action: Timestamp pages, include “last updated” metadata, and schedule small content updates (clarifying sentences, updated figures) at least every few weeks for important pages.\n   - Rationale: Systems that re-index on a timescale of days favor fresh content; updates increase the chance of being re-crawled and re-embedded [1].\n\n3. Optimize for embedding similarity, not keyword density\n   - Action: Use varied phrasing (synonyms, paraphrases) that captures the core concept without stuffing keywords. Add semantically rich lead sentences and examples.\n   - Rationale: Dense vector search finds semantically similar passages; diverse phrasings increase match probability across query formulations.\n\n4. Improve on-page signals that increase extraction confidence\n   - Action: Include citations, inline references to data, numbered lists, and schema markup where appropriate. Make authority explicit (author bio, credentials) on technical/medical/legal pages.\n   - Rationale: Models’ rerankers prefer passages they can map to verifiable facts; explicit signals reduce uncertainty in reranking and citation decisions.\n\n5. Create canonical, short “answer pages”\n   - Action: For high-value queries, build short canonical pages or answer snippets (200–400 words) devoted to the question with structured microcontent.\n   - Rationale: Small, focused pages are easier to use as evidence and are often preferred in generator contexts.\n\n6. Monitor training and ingestion footprints\n   - Action: Track where your content is indexed in public datasets, and use provider ingestion APIs if available. If you publish content you want to be authoritative, ensure it appears in accessible formats (HTML text, machine-readable PDFs).\n   - Rationale: Being present in the slices the model ingests or the retriever’s document store raises the chance of being retrieved and cited.\n\n7. Diversify content across formats and hosts\n   - Action: Publish short answer variants, longer canonical articles, and structured data (tables, JSON-LD). Mirror critical content across multiple domains or subdomains you control.\n   - Rationale: Retrieval systems draw from diverse corpora; content present in multiple clean, structured forms increases exposure probability.\n\n8. Test and iterate with observation\n   - Action: Build a small test harness to query assistant endpoints for your target questions, log which sources are cited, and measure changes after content updates.\n   - Rationale: Because linkage signals are less predictive, empirical A/B style testing against assistant outputs is the best way to measure impact.\n\nPut simply: make your content unambiguous, easy to extract, up-to-date, and present in forms that retrieval systems can index and embed reliably.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\nWorking with foundation-model-driven ranking introduces new challenges. Below are the most pressing ones and pragmatic mitigations.\n\n1. Challenge: You don’t control the model’s training data\n   - Problem: If the model was trained on competing sources, it may prefer those.\n   - Solution: Make your content uniquely authoritative and structured so it’s favored during retrieval/reranking; use publisher-friendly formats and public APIs to ensure inclusion in ingestion pipelines. When possible, publish content in repositories or domains commonly used for web-scale indexing.\n\n2. Challenge: Models hallucinate, then attribute confidently\n   - Problem: Generated answers sometimes invent facts and may cite irrelevant or incorrect sources.\n   - Solution: Use explicit, machine-readable citations on pages; structure content to contain verifiable snippets. If you operate a knowledge base, expose mature APIs so RAG systems can ground answers against your canonical data.\n\n3. Challenge: Rapid model iteration and cost change the landscape quickly\n   - Problem: With query costs dropping and model convergence, retrievers and rerankers evolve quickly; today’s rules may be obsolete within months.\n   - Solution: Invest in continuous measurement and modular content architecture. Treat content updates as part of product engineering cycles; measure citation incidence rather than relying on static SEO indicators.\n\n4. Challenge: Domain-specific trust requirements\n   - Problem: Legal, medical, and other regulated domains may use specialized rerankers and stricter evidence rules.\n   - Solution: Adopt domain best practices (credentials, clear disclaimers, references to primary literature), use schema appropriate to the domain, and participate in trusted medical/legal directories where possible.\n\n5. Challenge: Limited transparency from providers\n   - Problem: You often won’t know which checkpoints or data slices a deployed model was trained on.\n   - Solution: Operate on the assumption your content needs to be independently verifiable and extractable. Focus on signals the model can measure directly (textual clarity, structure, timestamps, citations) rather than trying to engineer around opaque training sets.\n\n6. Challenge: Inconsistent citation behavior across platforms\n   - Problem: Different assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Copilot) have varying retrieval stacks and citation policies.\n   - Solution: Prioritize universal signals (clarity, freshness, structure), but monitor platform-specific behavior and tailor content where there’s strategic value (e.g., short FAQs for instant-answer platforms).\n\n7. Challenge: Complex reasoning gaps\n   - Problem: Despite progress, models still struggle with some reasoning benchmarks (e.g., PlanBench), which affects how they handle multi-step queries.\n   - Solution: For multi-step or high-stakes content, present stepwise reasoning on your pages, include worked examples, and expose intermediate datasets—so the model can piece together reliable paths with lower hallucination risk [4].\n\nAddressing these challenges is less about gaming a single signal and more about engineering content to be a high-quality, low-ambiguity data source that plays well with dense retrieval + reranking pipelines.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nWhere do we go from here? The next 12–36 months will be defined by three converging trends: model convergence, cheaper inference, and industrialization of model training and deployment.\n\n1. Model convergence and homogenization\n   - Evidence: By early 2025 the Elo gap between models shrank (top vs. 10th from 11.9% to 5.4%; top two from 4.9% to 0.7%) [3].\n   - Outlook: As models converge, differentiation will shift to retrieval layers, data curation, and domain rerankers. The content surface that gets cited will be determined more by retrieval stacks and less by model idiosyncrasies.\n\n2. Cheaper inference & faster refresh cycles\n   - Evidence: Query costs fell from ~$20/million tokens (Nov 2022) to $0.07/million tokens (Oct 2024) for certain models — a ~280x drop [2].\n   - Outlook: Lower cost enables frequent re-indexing, near-real-time ingestion, and dynamic personalization. Freshness will increase in importance; content update cadence becomes a tactical lever.\n\n3. Industry dominance & operational maturity\n   - Evidence: Industry-created models represented ~90% of prominent models in 2024 (up from 60% in 2023), and training practices such as forking improved reproducibility [4][5].\n   - Outlook: Expect standardized ingestion pipelines, more API-based indexing channels, and commercial partnerships that allow prioritized ingestion. Organizations that align with provider ingestion expectations will gain visibility advantages.\n\n4. Improved small-model performance\n   - Evidence: Small models achieved previously large-model-only benchmarks (PaLM 540B in 2022 vs. Phi-3-mini 3.8B in 2024 for >60% MMLU) [2].\n   - Outlook: As smaller, cheaper models perform better, AI search will spread to edge devices and closed enterprise systems. Ensuring your content is available in formats those systems can index (enterprise connectors, RSS, JSON) will be crucial.\n\n5. Continued limitations in complex reasoning\n   - Evidence: Despite advances, models still struggle with certain reasoning benchmarks, and high-stakes domains will require hybrid human+AI workflows [4].\n   - Outlook: For sophisticated content, embedding evidence trails and exposing machine-verifiable reasoning chains on page will be decisive.\n\n6. Societal and standardization pressures\n   - Evidence: The field saw significant scientific recognition (noted Nobel- and Turing-level awards in 2024 in the reports), and regulators are increasing scrutiny [4].\n   - Outlook: Expect more provenance requirements, citation standards, and possibly accepted schemas for AI-grade evidence. Early adopters of rigorous provenance and schema practices will fare better.\n\nIn short: the environment will reward clarity, verifiability, and accessibility. The “neural network hierarchy” will continue to privilege signals that map directly onto model internals—fresh, extractable, machine-friendly content—so organizations that build content pipelines like engineering artifacts will win.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe shift from link graphs to neural hierarchies is real, measurable, and fast-moving. The April–June 2025 evidence base is clear: AI citation behavior across millions of results is overwhelmingly driven by model-side signals—embeddings, freshness, extractability, and reranker confidence—not traditional backlinks or raw traffic counts [1][2][3][4][5]. Model convergence and plummeting inference costs only accelerate the pace of change, making frequent re-indexing and better-structured content practical and necessary.\n\nFor practitioners focused on ranking in LLM results, the takeaway is simple but profound: design content as input to a neural pipeline, not just a human reader. Give models clean answer spans, clear timestamps, verifiable claims, and machine-readable metadata. Measure what matters (citation incidence, retrieval presence) and iterate rapidly. If you do, the new paradigm favors those who are precise, up-to-date, and structured — not necessarily those with the biggest link graphs.\n\nActionable summary (quick):\n- Create short, extractable answer blocks.\n- Update important pages frequently and surface last-updated metadata.\n- Use structured data and citations to reduce reranker uncertainty.\n- Test assistant outputs directly and iterate based on observed citations.\n- Ensure content is available in ingestion-friendly formats.\n\nThe neural network hierarchy won’t make backlinks irrelevant forever; backlinks still matter for many purposes. But when it comes to being cited inside an LLM answer, your best bet is to speak the model’s language: concise, factual, fresh, and structured.",
