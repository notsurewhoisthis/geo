Brands that spent years—and millions—building SEO equity are waking up to a harsh reality: the rules have changed, and many of their hard-won signals no longer matter the way they used to. Headlines and industry chatter now point to a startling figure: roughly “67% of brands” are being effectively invisible or underrepresented in answers produced by major LLM-based search interfaces such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. Before you chalk that up to clickbait, read this exposé: the evidence for an “AI visibility crisis” is substantial even if the exact percentage remains debated. The trend is real. The consequences are not theoretical.\n\nWhy you should care: ChatGPT is no longer a curiosity—it’s a dominant gateway. By mid‑2025 the platform was registering enormous traffic (Brand24 reported 1.4 billion monthly visits as of June 2025), and earlier reports placed ChatGPT at roughly 180 million users and ~600 million monthly visits (The Frank Agency, Dec 2024). Even if you accept the lower or higher estimate, the takeaway is identical: billions of consumer interactions are shifting into AI-driven experiences that synthesize answers from a limited set of sources and internal knowledge. For brands, failing to show up in those synthesized answers is equivalent to vanishing from a new kind of digital map.\n\nThis piece is an exposé aimed at visibility leaders, digital marketers, CMOs, and product owners who need to understand what’s happening, why it’s happening, and how the smartest companies are already fighting back using entity-based optimization and other AI-specific hygiene. We’ll walk through the mechanics of the problem, unpack the data, show real-world tactics that are working (including newly launched tracking tools), and give actionable steps you can implement now to stop the bleeding and begin reclaiming AI-first mindshare.\n\nIf you run a brand that depends on discovery—retail, hospitality, consumer tech, services—this is not a niche problem. The next sections explain exactly how 67% was estimated in industry discussion, why traditional SEO falls short against LLM search, and how entity‑based strategies are emerging as the new competitive moat.\n\n## Understanding the AI Visibility Crisis\n\nThe AI visibility crisis is a structural problem rooted in how large language models (LLMs) generate answers. Unlike web search engines that return ranked lists of URLs, modern LLM-driven search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other LLM front-ends) synthesizes information into a single conversational response. That shift—list-to-synthesis—creates a radically different signal economy.\n\nHow LLM answers are produced (simplified):\n- The model relies on pretraining data plus retrieval from a curated set of sources or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) layer.\n- When producing a response, the system weights authoritative, concise, and frequently referenced sources.\n- Many platforms also favor sources that are crawlable, structured, and contain entity-rich metadata.\n\nThe immediate effect: if your brand isn’t present in the narrow set of sources the model consults—or if your brand isn’t modeled as a strong entity in the model’s index—you will rarely appear in the synthesized response. That’s where the “erased” narrative comes from.\n\nKey supporting data points:\n- Platform scale: ChatGPT’s traffic makes it a major discovery channel—reports vary but include 1.4 billion monthly visits (Brand24, Jun 2025) and earlier figures citing ~180 million users and ~600 million monthly visits (The Frank Agency, Dec 2024). Put simply: ignoring ChatGPT is akin to ignoring a top global search destination.\n- Search volume comparisons: In 2024 ChatGPT processed an estimated ~37.5 million searches per day versus Google’s ~14 billion—small by Google’s scale but large and growing (Exploding Topics reporting). More importantly, industry analysis projects that AI search traffic could overtake organic search traffic by 2028.\n- Market share dynamics: Google still dominates conventional search (over 90% market share with ~21.6% growth between 2023–2024), but AI alternatives are rapidly becoming a complementary and, in some scenarios, preferred starting point.\n\nWhy the “67%” figure circulates\nThe 67% claim has been used by analysts and agency reports to convey the scale of brands that lack meaningful representation in AI-generated answers across ChatGPT and Perplexity. It’s a composite estimate, not a single peer‑reviewed study: it arises from brand-citation audits, content gap analyses, and crawling snapshots that show many mid-size and smaller brands absent from LLM answer citations. The exact share will vary by vertical and query intent, but the broader insight is robust: a majority of brands do not have reliable, entity-level signals that LLMs rely on.\n\nCrucially, LLMs favor:\n- Established authorities (Wikipedia, major publishers)\n- Platforms with strong review/reputation datasets (Amazon, Trustpilot)\n- Structured knowledge graphs and well-formed schema\nIf your brand is neither frequently cited nor structurally represented, you’re at risk of being omitted.\n\n## Key Components and Analysis\n\nTo address the crisis, we need to break down the core components causing brand erasure and analyze how they interact.\n\n1) Entity presence and knowledge graphs\nLLMs increasingly act as an overlay to knowledge graphs and connected entity networks. If your brand doesn’t have a solid “entity card” in public graphs—clear name variations, canonical URLs, structured schema, and cross‑platform citations—your probability of appearing in an answer drops sharply. This is why companies that invest in entity-building (consistent NAP, robust About pages, and linked data markup) see disproportionate returns in AI contexts.\n\n2) Source authority bias\nWhen LLMs synthesize, they tend to lean on high-authority sources. The result is a “rich get richer” effect: Wikipedia, large news outlets, academic repositories, and big e-commerce platforms get cited most. For smaller brands, cracking that citation set requires presence on those platforms—customer reviews on Trustpilot, mentions in authoritative blogs, or structured entries in industry directories.\n\n3) Training-data and retrieval cutoff\nMost LLMs are trained on data from a point in time and rely on an indexed retrieval set to fetch the latest info. If a brand’s major growth, rebranding, or product launches occurred after the model’s cutoff—or happened in content that’s not indexed properly—the model can’t accurately represent you. That delay creates systemic underrepresentation for fast-moving or recently scaled companies.\n\n4) Crawlability and AI-specific permissions\nTechnical infrastructure matters. Some companies are now adopting llms.txt controls and ensuring their robots.txt and sitemap configurations are AI-friendly, enabling LLMs and RAG systems to find, index, and use branded content. Conversely, brands that unintentionally block AI crawlers—or serve inconsistent content to bot user agents—may be invisible to retrieval systems.\n\n5) The rise of branded AI and “private GPTs”\nSavvy organizations are creating custom GPTs (private or hosted) seeded with proprietary knowledge bases. These branded AI experiences allow companies to bypass public LLM shortcomings, offering accurate product guidance, troubleshooting, and brand voice. While this secures customer experiences, it doesn’t automatically translate into presence in open ChatGPT/Perplexity answers—unless the brand also builds public entity signals.\n\n6) Visibility measurement tools\nUntil recently tracking LLM visibility was guesswork. That changed with August 2025 product launches: Ahrefs introduced Brand Radar specifically capable of tracking ChatGPT mentions and domain citation analysis in LLM responses. Complementary upgrades from platforms like Semrush provide AI-visibility sentiment and language-model specific metrics. These tools illuminate which sources LLMs favor, and where brands are missing, making strategic remediation possible.\n\n7) Industry adoption rates and stakes\nChatGPT is not uniformly important across industries. First Page Sage’s data (Aug 2025) shows variations in ChatGPT usage in purchase journeys—Travel & Hospitality (18%), Retail & CPG (16%), IT Services (14%), Lifestyle/Health/Wellness (13%), Food & Beverage (13%). Those percentages translate into enormous financial exposure—travel alone represents an estimated $1.48 trillion stake where ChatGPT influences purchases. For industries with high ChatGPT usage, being invisible equates to lost revenue opportunity.\n\n8) Economic signals\nAdoption of AI internally also affects visibility calculus. Reports show that roughly 25% of organizations report cost savings of $50k–$70k from ChatGPT integrations, with some reporting savings above $100k. ChatGPT Plus counts about 10 million paying subscribers at $20/month—indicating a strong commercial base. The more businesses and consumers rely on LLM tools, the more critical AI visibility becomes.\n\n## Practical Applications: What Smart Companies Are Doing Now\n\nIf your brand is facing potential erasure, here are pragmatic, prioritized actions companies are using to gain ground. These are battle-tested tactics—some basic, some advanced—that collectively form an entity-based SEO playbook for the AI age.\n\nImmediate (0–30 days)\n- Audit public entity presence: gather a list of all places your brand is referenced—Wikipedia, Wikidata, Trustpilot, Glassdoor, industry directories, major review sites. Map frequency and quality of mentions.\n- Fix canonical and structured data: ensure your site has consistent canonical URLs and core structured markup (Organization schema, Product schema, FAQ schema, and Where applicable, HowTo/Service schemas). LLM retrieval favors well-structured, unambiguous data.\n- Ensure crawlability: review robots.txt and sitemaps. Remove accidental blocks that prevent RAG systems and crawlers from indexing key pages. Consider adding an llms.txt policy where relevant to indicate content usability for AI systems.\n\nShort-term (1–3 months)\n- Build cross-platform citations: secure entries and accurate profiles on high-authority platforms—Wikipedia (where notable), Wikidata, Crunchbase, major industry directories, and top review platforms such as Trustpilot. These are high-leverage placements for AI retrieval.\n- Generate entity-focused content: shift some editorial focus from keyword-stuffed pages to concise, authoritative pieces that answer entity-level queries (e.g., “What is [Brand]’s warranty policy?”). Use clear, canonical phrasing and schema to increase the chance of being used as a direct source.\n- Launch brand-safe GPTs: develop internal GPT assistants seeded with your docs, product manuals, and FAQs for customer support. While this doesn’t immediately coat public LLM responses, it secures your customer experience and gives you repurposable assets.\n\nMid-term (3–9 months)\n- Invest in reputation signals: actively collect and manage reviews on platforms that LLMs commonly cite. High-volume, well-structured reviews create strong signal clusters that LLM retrieval hooks onto.\n- Monitor and measure: adopt tools like Ahrefs Brand Radar to track where ChatGPT mentions your brand, what sources are cited, and how visibility changes over time. Combine this with Semrush AI metrics for sentiment analysis of LLM responses.\n- Content placement strategy: secure guest posts and industry features on authoritative sites. The goal is not just links but being repeatedly cited by the sources LLMs trust.\n\nLonger-term (9–18 months)\n- Create an entity knowledge hub: a public, crawlable resource on your domain that aggregates company facts, press releases, structured data, and downloadable assets. This hub should be optimized explicitly for consumption by RAG pipelines.\n- Partnerships with platforms: build integrations or partnership content with platforms that feed RAG layers (publishing canonical data feeds, APIs, or data partnerships).\n- Internal governance: establish an AI visibility team responsible for entity health—managing structured data, coordinating PR to increase authoritative mentions, and building custom GPT experiences for owned channels.\n\nActionable quick wins checklist\n- Add Organization and Logo schema to your homepage.\n- Publish a concise “Company Facts” HTML page with bullet facts and dates.\n- Claim and update profiles on Trustpilot, Crunchbase, industry directories, and Wikidata.\n- Run an immediate crawlability test and fix any blocks for indexers.\n- Set up monitoring for ChatGPT mentions via Brand Radar or Semrush AI tools.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\nThis section exposes the friction points you’ll encounter and the defensive/offensive solutions that actually work.\n\nChallenge: Lack of transparency in LLM sourcing\nMost LLM interfaces historically offered little clarity about which sources were used to craft a given answer. That opacity made it impossible to know whether your absence reflected a true omission or just an algorithmic artifact.\n\nSolution:\n- Use tools that reveal citation behavior. Ahrefs Brand Radar and updated Semrush features now surface LLM-cited domains and visibility trends. Monitor which sources are repeatedly used for your key queries and prioritize presence there.\n- Leverage Response-Level Evidence: when LLMs do cite, examine the exact phrasing and source type. That tells you whether the model prefers FAQs, long-form articles, review snippets, or knowledge base entries.\n\nChallenge: Authority bias and the “rich get richer” dynamic\nLLMs tend to recirculate a tight set of authoritative sources, making it hard for midsize brands to break through.\n\nSolution:\n- Earn high-authority mentions through PR and thought leadership—target outlets that LLMs repeatedly cite.\n- Create authoritative, concise explainers that answer user intent better than competitor pieces. LLM retrieval favors concise, definitive content.\n\nChallenge: Fast-moving brands vs. model cutoffs\nIf a brand changes rapidly or launches new products frequently, the model’s training cutoff can leave the brand out of date.\n\nSolution:\n- Push canonical, time-stamped resources to public feeds and ensure they’re crawlable. Press releases, GitHub repos, and industry filings are frequently indexed by RAG layers.\n- Use real-time integrations or partnership APIs with major platforms where possible.\n\nChallenge: Technical inertia and organizational silos\nSEO teams are often separate from product and legal teams that manage robots.txt, and many companies don’t know who owns entity health.\n\nSolution:\n- Create a cross-functional “AI visibility” task force that includes SEO, engineering, product, PR, and legal. This team should be empowered to change crawl rules, publish canonical pages, and coordinate external partnerships.\n\nChallenge: Measuring ROI and proving the business case\nBoards want numbers. Early AI visibility wins can be hard to attribute.\n\nSolution:\n- Start with measurable pilot projects: track citation share, LLM mention volume, and downstream clicks to your site from LLM-driven interactions (when available). Combine visibility changes with business metrics—search referral uplift, conversion lift on branded queries, and reductions in support cost thanks to branded GPTs.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nThe next three years will define winners and losers in the AI visibility race. Here’s how I see the landscape evolving and what you need to prepare for.\n\nShort term (next 12–18 months)\n- Visibility tools mature rapidly. Ahrefs’ Brand Radar (Aug 2025) and Semrush’s AI features are the leading edge of a wider industry shift to measuring LLM visibility. Expect more platforms to add LLM-specific reporting, enabling systematic optimization.\n- More brands will adopt entity-first strategies. The early adopters who standardized entity data, earned authoritative mentions, and published AI-friendly knowledge hubs will see compounding visibility gains.\n\nMedium term (2026–2028)\n- AI search will increasingly be the first touchpoint for discovery. Industry projections suggest AI search traffic could overtake organic search by 2028. Brands that don’t build entity presence and strategic retrieval assets risk being effectively absent from a growing share of purchase journeys.\n- Monetization and walled gardens will alter visibility. Paid features and integrations may give brands additional channels to surface within proprietary AI experiences, but they’ll be supplement—not replace—fundamental entity-building.\n\nLong term (beyond 2028)\n- Entity-based optimization becomes mainstream. Just as technical SEO and link-building matured into standard practices, entity health will be a routine part of digital marketing budgets and org charts.\n- New regulatory and transparency standards may emerge. As LLMs play a larger role in discovery, expect calls for better source attribution and standards for corporate data feeding into public models.\n\nA final sharp observation: the brands that treat AI visibility as a technical and strategic discipline—rather than a side project of content marketing—will dominate the next wave. The winners will combine structured data rigor, high-authority citations, direct branded AI experiences, and monitoring systems to ensure their entity is always available to RAG pipelines.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is an exposé, but it’s also a call to arms. The “67% erased” narrative—while an industry estimate—is a symptom of a real, measurable shift: the ascendancy of synthesis-driven discovery and the consequent revaluation of what it means to be visible online. ChatGPT’s enormous audience (reported figures vary from ~600 million to 1.4 billion monthly visits) and the rising market share of AI-flavored discovery mean that being invisible in LLM outputs is not an academic problem—it’s a direct threat to revenue, reputation, and customer acquisition.\n\nThe good news: the problem is tractable. Entity-based optimization, technical crawlability, authoritative citations, reputation signals, and branded GPT experiences are all levers you can pull today. Tools like Ahrefs Brand Radar and augmented Semrush features finally give brands the visibility into LLM behavior needed to act decisively.\n\nIf you walk away with one thing from this piece: treat AI visibility as a first-class discipline. Build your entity, own your facts, and get present where LLMs fetch their answers. The brands that do will stop being “erased” and start being the ones AI recommends.\n\nActionable takeaways (one more time, succinct)\n- Run an immediate entity audit: Wikidata, Wikipedia, Trustpilot, major directories.\n- Ensure your site’s structured data (Organization, Product, FAQ) is precise and crawlable.\n- Add a public “Company Facts” knowledge hub optimized for RAG consumption.\n- Use Ahrefs Brand Radar and Semrush AI tools to monitor ChatGPT mentions and source citations.\n- Collect authoritative reviews and secure guest placements on top-cited outlets.\n- Build branded GPTs for owned experiences and align those assets with public entity signals.\n\nThe era of keyword-first SEO is closing. The era of entity-first visibility is here. Act now—or watch AI rewrite your brand out of the narrative.",
