 üéØ Master Prompt: Automated SEO Content Pipeline

  Project Context

  You're building an n8n automation workflow that creates a self-sustaining SEO content machine.
  This system will automatically discover trending topics, research them deeply, generate
  SEO-optimized pages, and deploy them to a Next.js website hosted on Heroku via GitHub.

your project folder is here: 
/Users/heni/GEO
github url https://github.com/notsurewhoisthis/geo - you can login via  github cli / mcp to make sure it‚Äôs set up as intented. 
web page hosted on heroku: https://geo-engine-optimization-3b7f09edc005.herokuapp.com/ use heroku login command to login and make the necessary changes when needed. 
Domain is generative-engine.org use cloudflare mcp to configure the domain so all new pages are under this domain. 


  Core Requirements

  üìä Workflow Architecture

  Create an n8n workflow with the following sequential nodes:

  1. Trend Discovery Node (Perplexity API)
    - Query: "What are the top 5 trending topics in Generative engine optimisation today/this week that people are searching for
   but have limited quality content available? Make sure you check linkedin and reddit for this on top of other sources.‚Äù
    - Extract: topic name, search volume indicators, competition level
    - Output format: JSON with slug, title, keywords[], searchIntent
  2. Deep Research Node (Perplexity API - Enhanced)
    - For each trending topic, execute 3 research queries:
        - "Comprehensive guide about [TOPIC]: facts, statistics, expert opinions"
      - "Common questions and pain points about [TOPIC]"
      - "Latest developments and future predictions for [TOPIC]"
    - Aggregate research into structured data
  3. Content Generation Node (OpenAI/Claude API)
    - Generate full page content (2000-3000 words)
    - Include: H1, meta description, multiple H2/H3 sections, FAQ section
    - Output as structured JSON matching your existing blog post schema
  4. Page Creation Node (Code Node)
    - Generate Next.js page file at app/[topic-slug]/page.tsx
    - Create JSON data file at public/blog-data/[topic-slug].json
    - Follow exact structure from lookatmyprofile-web project
  5. SEO Enhancement Node
    - Update app/sitemap.xml/route.ts with new page
    - Inject internal links into 3-5 existing related pages

  Build Instructions

  1. Create n8n workflow with the nodes described above
  2. Test with a single topic first
  3. Verify GitHub integration works
  4. Confirm Heroku auto-deploys
  5. Monitor for 24 hours before full automation
  6. Set up error notifications via email/Slack

  Remember: Every generated page should be indistinguishable from manually created pages in terms of
   quality, SEO optimization, and design consistency.
