<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is rapidly moving from a speculative discipline into an operational necessity for brands, publishers and search practitioners. But in 2025, GEO still sits on shaky foundations: the AI systems that power generative search and overviews often cite incorrectly, inconsistently, or with misplaced confidence. That matters because GEO tools—those dashboards, crawlers, and ranking models built to help content owners win visibility in generative search—are only as useful as the signals they track. If the underlying AI citation behavior is noisy, biased toward particular sources, or outright error-prone, then optimization driven by flawed telemetry will mislead decision-makers and waste resources.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">This article is a technical deep-dive for the GEO audience: engineers, product managers and advanced SEOs building or buying GEO tooling. I&#39;ll synthesize the key empirical findings from multiple 2024–2025 studies, explain why most current GEO tools are missing the mark, break down the mechanics of AI citation behavior across platforms, and map that analysis into pragmatic, technical fixes and product requirements. I’ll incorporate concrete research data—error rates from Columbia University’s Tow Center (March 2025), cross-platform citation analyses (August 2024–June 2025), and August/June 2025 SERP-citation alignment metrics—so you can see exactly where the signals break and why a different approach is required.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">If you build GEO functionality—whether internal tooling or a SaaS product—this piece will give you an engineering checklist and product roadmap: what to measure, how to model AI citation risk, and which optimization strategies actually move the needle in an ecosystem where <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="60%">60%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="60%">60%</mark></mark>+ of <a href="/entities/ai-citations" title="How AI Citations Work" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">AI citations</a> to news can be wrong, and where <a href="/entities/chatgpt-optimization" title="ChatGPT Optimization Guide" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">ChatGPT</a> leans on Wikipedia for nearly half of its top citations.

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">In March 2025 Columbia University’s Tow Center published a wake-up call: when asked about news articles, major generative AI systems returned incorrect answers more than <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="60%">60%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="60%">60%</mark></mark> of the time. That’s not a rounding error—it’s a fundamental signal that AI-driven citations are noisy. The Tow Center’s testing across eight major systems revealed dramatic platform variance: <a href="/entities/perplexity-optimization" title="Perplexity Search Optimization" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">Perplexity</a>’s incorrect response rate was <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="37%">37%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="37%">37%</mark></mark> (i.e., roughly <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="63%">63%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="63%">63%</mark></mark> accurate), while Grok 3 produced a catastrophic <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="94%">94%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="94%">94%</mark></mark> error rate in the same tests. Equally alarming: these systems often answered with high confidence and rarely hedged. For example, ChatGPT signaled explicit uncertainty only <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="15 times">15 times</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="15 times">15 times</mark></mark> out of 200 responses the study evaluated—an indicator that systems undercommunicate their own epistemic limits.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">A separate large-scale analysis between August 2024 and June 2025 examined roughly 30 million citations across ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity. That study exposed highly platform-specific citation patterns: ChatGPT, for instance, disproportionately cites Wikipedia—Wikipedia accounted for <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="47.9%">47.9%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="47.9%">47.9%</mark></mark> of ChatGPT’s top-10 frequently cited sources. Perplexity, conversely, showed citation behavior that aligned more closely with traditional SERP authority: a June 2025 analysis found that Perplexity’s citations were most consistent with Google’s top-10 organic rankings.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">August 2025 data further complicates the picture: <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.58%">40.58%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.58%">40.58%</mark></mark> of AI citations across the sampled systems originated from pages ranked in Google’s top-10. That sounds like a comforting bridge between old-school SEO and GEO: high-ranking content still matters. But another critical finding undermines keyword-centric playbooks: <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="86.85%">86.85%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="86.85%">86.85%</mark></mark> of AI Overviews do not include the user’s exact query phrase in the excerpted text. In effect, generative systems prefer semantic, contextual matches over literal keyword matches. Samanyou Garg’s framing—“content optimized for context and clarity, not just keywords, wins both traditional SERPs and AI-generated citations”—underscores a major shift in what GEO must measure.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Finally, citation concentration metrics tell a nuanced story: content ranking #1 organically has a <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="33.07%">33.07%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="33.07%">33.07%</mark></mark> chance of being included in AI citations, and content in the top 10 captures <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.85%">40.85%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.85%">40.85%</mark></mark> of AI overview citations. This means that while search authority still helps, being #1 is not sufficient to guarantee generative visibility. Each platform applies its own heuristics to produce overviews, and those heuristics weight signals differently—leading to divergent citation behavior across ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity and other emergent systems.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Taken together, these findings prove two things: first, generative citation behavior is noisy and platform-specific; second, the signal set GEO tools must capture and act on is far broader than classic ranking metrics and keyword counts. Most GEO tools today are designed for the latter and thus are not fit for the former.</p>

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">To understand why GEO tooling is falling short, we need to break down the components that determine whether a piece of content surfaces as a citation in a generative overview, and where tooling typically fails.</p>
<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Signal diversity and weighting</p>

<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Traditional SEO metrics (backlinks, PageRank proxies, on-page keywords, page speed) remain relevant—<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.58%">40.58%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.58%">40.58%</mark></mark> of AI citations coming from Google top-10 pages proves that. But generative systems inject additional, non-traditional signals: provenance reliability, structured metadata<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value=", times">, times</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value=", times">, times</mark></mark>tamp freshness, entity resolution (how well content maps to canonical entities), and redundance in the training or retrieval index.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Many GEO tools still over-index on legacy signals and treat generative visibility as a function of improving SERP rank. That’s insufficient because generative engines sometimes prefer canonical knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia) or high-quality semantic matches over raw rank.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Platform-specific citation heuristics</p>

GEO tools that ignore Wikipedia’s role are blind to a prime signal.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Perplexity’s higher alignment with Google’s top-10 suggests that a single GEO strategy won’t work across platforms. A tool that assumes uniform behavior across AIs will produce brittle recommendations.</li>

This semantic-first behavior breaks keyword-density models and favors content that encodes facts clearly, uses canonical entity identifiers (schema.org, <a href="/entities" title="GEO Knowledge Graph" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">Knowledge Graph</a> markup), and offers structured summaries.</li>

<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The 30-million-citation dataset highlights another weakness: sampling matters.

<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Provenance and citation chaining</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Generative systems sometimes cite derivative pages that themselves cite primary sources. A tool that only tracks the final URL misses the citation chain: error can creep in when secondary summaries misrepresent primary documents.

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">When you aggregate these components, two central technical conclusions emerge: GEO must evolve beyond singular SEO proxies, and tooling must model multi-dimensional risk (source accuracy, temporal mismatch, entity mapping, platform preference). Failing to do so is why many GEO tools are, today, missing the mark.</p>

<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">As the importance of source accuracy becomes mainstream, expect standards and best practices to emerge for machine-readable provenance: stronger adoption of schema.org provenance properties, more extensive use of DOIs or canonical identifiers, and possibly industry-driven provenance registries. Tools like Sourcely show an early attempt to codify metadata extraction for citations; this will become mainstream.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Beyond tooling, AI providers will be pushed—by regulators, publishers, and enterprise clients—to improve citation fidelity. But even if models improve, the diversity of platforms and the semantic nature of generative retrieval means GEO needs to remain a first-class engineering discipline. The market will reward those who build tooling that is platform-agnostic at the observability layer but platform-aware at the optimization layer.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">A second-order effect: organizations that master provenance and Wikipedia hygiene will enjoy outsized benefits. Because ChatGPT relies heavily on Wikipedia and other canonical repositories, institutions that invest in accurate, well-cited encyclopedic entries will see improved visibility across platforms that favor canonical knowledge.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Finally, expect consolidation and specialization. The GEO product category will split into observability platforms, content remediation engines, and entity/knowledge graph services. Vendors capable of integrating all three—large-scale telemetry, automated remediation, and deep entity modeling—will become essential partners for enterprises.</p>

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">In 2025 the GEO landscape is at a crossroads. On the one hand, generative systems are reshaping how users discover and consume information. On the other hand, the citation foundations underneath those systems are brittle: studies show &gt;<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="60%">60%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="60%">60%</mark></mark> error rates on news citations, platform-by-platform variance (Perplexity vs Grok 3), and the surprising concentration of citations—ChatGPT draws nearly half of its citations from Wikipedia. Additionally, the fact that <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="86.85%">86.85%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="86.85%">86.85%</mark></mark> of AI overviews do not echo exact query phrasing demolishes the old keyword-first playbook.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Most GEO tools were designed when optimization equaled improving SERP rank and keyword visibility. That paradigm is now incomplete. The next-gen GEO stack must be observability-centric, entity-aware, provenance-first and platform-sensitive. Practically, that means building pipelines for multi-platform telemetry, provenance graphing, entity linking, semantic content scoring, and temporal risk monitoring. It also means operational changes: invest in Wikipedia hygiene, create editorial processes for real-time remediation, and adopt conservative thresholds that respect the high error rates shown in 2025 research.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">If you’re building or buying GEO tooling this year, treat the Tow Center and the 30-million-citation analyses as design constraints, not optional readings. Practical GEO success will come to teams that instrument the problem rigorously, design for platform diversity, and prioritize provenance over model confidence. The opportunity is tremendous: generative engines still rely on the same few authoritative sources and top-ranked content for much of their citations (<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="33.07%">33.07%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="33.07%">33.07%</mark></mark> chance for #1 content; <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.85%">40.85%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="40.85%">40.85%</mark></mark> for top-10 coverage), so a hybrid strategy—preserving SEO foundations while mastering entity and provenance mechanics—will deliver outsized, defensible visibility wins.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Actionable takeaways (quick recap)</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Build multi-platform telemetry and synthetic query sets; sample at scale.  </li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Model provenance robustness, not model confidence; reconstruct citation chains.  </li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Prioritize entity linking, schema markup and semantic content formats over keyword stuffing.  </li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Invest in Wikipedia and canonical data hygiene for high-impact entities.  </li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Implement temporal risk dashboards and real-time alerting for misinformation.  </li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Treat GEO tooling as observability infrastructure that must adapt rapidly to platform drift.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">The tools that embrace these principles will be the ones that stop “missing the mark”—and instead shape how information is surfaced in a generative-first web.</p>
