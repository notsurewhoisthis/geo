<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">If you think SEO skirmishes were messy before, welcome to the new frontlines: generative engine optimization (GEO). Instead of tinkering with page titles, backlink profiles and meta descriptions, a growing cohort of marketers is trying to influence the outputs of <a href="/entities/llm-optimization" title="LLM Optimization Guide" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">large language models</a> and AI search agents — most notably <a href="/entities/chatgpt-optimization" title="ChatGPT Optimization Guide" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">ChatGPT</a> — to hijack brand mentions, citations and discovery moments. This is not theoretical. It’s an arms race that&#39;s already reshaping how people find, evaluate and decide on brands. In this exposé I&#39;ll pull back the curtain on the tactics, the scale, the incentives and the companies driving what I’m calling the “AI citation hustle.”</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Why this matters: ChatGPT and other AI search tools are no longer fringe. ChatGPT reportedly commanded <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="69.9%">69.9%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="69.9%">69.9%</mark></mark> of the market share for subscription sales of AI tools in January 2024, and by February 2025 the platform had between 800 million and 1 billion users overall with roughly 400 million weekly active users. In 2024 the service processed about 37.5 million searches per day — tiny compared to Google’s 14 billion daily searches, but growing fast enough that industry forecasts project AI search engines could overtake organic search traffic by 2028. When an AI agent with that level of reach cites or mentions a brand, it can create discovery and credibility moments that rival traditional search results. That potential has turned AI responses into a new commodity; and where there’s value, there’s manipulation.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">This is not just about someone writing spammy “X vs Y” posts. The mechanics are more sophisticated: edit wars on authoritative pages, coordinated networks of synthetic content, targeted “comparison” campaigns designed specifically to seed AI training data with favorable frames. The result is a feedback loop: <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark></mark> of AI Overview citations contain AI-generated content, meaning AI can increasingly cite machine-made material to answer human queries — amplifying any manipulation baked into that material. Today we’ll dissect who’s doing this, how they do it, why it matters for your brand and digital behavior, and what you can do to defend your reputation in an era of AI citation warfare.</p>

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Generative engine optimization, AI SEO, <a href="/entities/chatgpt-optimization" title="ChatGPT Optimization Guide" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">ChatGPT optimization</a>—call it what you want—the aim is the same: influence what AI agents say and which sources they cite when users ask about your category, product or competitor. Traditional SEO optimized for the crawl-and-index behavior of search engines. GEO optimizes for the training corpora, retrieval documents and prompt/response behaviors of generative models and AI search products. For brands focused on discovery and credibility, that’s a seismic shift in strategy.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">At the core of the hustles are three converging trends. First, the rise of AI-generated content as both creator and source. Studies show an increasing share of sources that AI models reference are themselves AI-generated: <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark></mark> of AI Overview citations contain AI-generated content. That means an AI can cite AI — a closed loop that rewards volume and replication more than editorial quality. Second, distribution and concentration of authority. Platforms like Wikipedia still dominate as input sources: Wikipedia appears most frequently in ChatGPT citations (<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="16.3%">16.3%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="16.3%">16.3%</mark></mark>), followed by <a href="/entities/perplexity-optimization" title="Perplexity Search Optimization" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">Perplexity</a> (<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="12.5%">12.5%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="12.5%">12.5%</mark></mark>) and Google AI Overviews (<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="8.4%">8.4%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="8.4%">8.4%</mark></mark>). That concentration means winning a small set of authoritative touchpoints yields outsized influence on AI outputs. Third, user reach and behavior. With ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly users and the platform processing millions of daily searches, being included in AI responses can equate to major brand reach and earned credibility.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Marketers have noticed. Many now treat AI agents as the front page of the internet: you don’t just want to rank on Google; you want to be referenced by the model users consult. Semrush and other SEO tool vendors have introduced AI Optimization features — metrics that track brand presence across LLM responses, sentiment in AI replies and “share of voice” inside generative agent outputs. In short: the market is legitimizing GEO as a practice, and marketers are investing accordingly.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">It’s important to emphasize scale. Organizations using AI for content are publishing more: one dataset notes a <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="42%">42%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="42%">42%</mark></mark> increase in monthly content production (rising from an average of 12 to 17 articles per month). AI-assisted blog tools have reported up to <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="120%">120%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="120%">120%</mark></mark> lifts in organic traffic within six months when paired with human editing and distribution. Yet only about <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="4%">4%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="4%">4%</mark></mark> of companies publish unedited AI content, which means most manipulation campaigns are at least semi-curated by humans — making them more credible and more dangerous. Meanwhile, social media feeds are being flooded by synthetic assets: an estimated <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="71%">71%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="71%">71%</mark></mark> of social media images are AI-generated in certain contexts, giving manipulators visual cover and the ability to seed networks with branded visuals.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Understand this: the AI citation hustle isn’t some fringe experiment. It’s a coordinated, multi-channel play that mixes old-school marketing (PR, link-building, comparison content) with new technical awareness (<a href="/entities/prompt-engineering" title="Prompt Engineering for GEO" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">prompt engineering</a>, training-data seeding, model behavior testing). And because it targets how models reason and which sources they prefer, it can bypass many of the defenses brands built for traditional SEO.</p>

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Analysis: The Hustle Works Because Users Trust AI<br>People increasingly treat ChatGPT as an authoritative starting point. Marketing professionals reflect that trust: <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="77.9%">77.9%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="77.9%">77.9%</mark></mark> of marketers trust ChatGPT most among AI tools, far ahead of rivals like <a href="/entities/claude-optimization" title="Claude AI Optimization" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">Claude</a>. When a widely trusted model references a brand or frames a comparison, it creates an impression of authority even if the underlying sources were manipulated. Combine that with ChatGPT’s user base — hundreds of millions of weekly active users — and you’ve got an information channel that can rewrite first impressions at scale.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Economic incentives also matter. <a href="/entities/chatgpt-optimization" title="OpenAI ChatGPT Guide" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">OpenAI</a>’s paid subscriptions generated roughly <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$2.7 billion">$2.7 billion</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$2.7 billion">$2.7 billion</mark></mark> in annual revenue (projected to climb toward <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$4 billion">$4 billion</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$4 billion">$4 billion</mark></mark> by the end of 2025).

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">If you’re a marketer tempted to exploit the hustle — or a brand owner who wants to defend against it — here are practical tactics both sides use, explained plainly so you can recognize them.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">For opportunistic marketers (the hustlers)</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Seed comparison hubs: Create high-volume “versus” content and get it onto aggregator sites. Use AI to draft iterations, then human-edit to smooth credibility.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Target citation hubs: Prioritize authority surfaces like Wikipedia, major review sites and Perplexity. Invest in PR and data-driven outreach to get mentioned in those pages.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Build synthetic networks: Publish similar narratives across dozens of microblogs, forums and social channels. Interlink them to create retrieval signals.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Use prompt optimization tests: Iterate prompts that produce version of an answer which favor your phrasing and brand. Document which prompts cause the model to cite your content sources, then design content to match those prompts.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Monitor AI outputs: Tools that track “share of voice” inside model responses let you see if your campaigns actually change what the AI says.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">For brands defending their reputation (the targets)</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Harden authoritative pages: Monitor and manage Wikipedia pages, PR profiles, company pages and industry glossaries. Use vigilant editorial oversight and rapid response to bad edits or false framing.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Publish model-friendly canonical content: Create structured, authoritative pages that answer common comparative questions. Use clear headings, schema, FAQs and short, model-friendly summaries so retrieval systems prefer your content.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Seed trusted third-party coverage: Work with reputable journalists, analysts and aggregators to create independent coverage that’s harder to fake or manipulate.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Monitor AI mentions proactively: Use AI-aware monitoring tools and set alerts for changes in how AI agents describe your brand versus competitors.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Legal and policy action: For egregious cases (defamatory or deceptive manipulation), pursue takedowns or legal remedies. Document networks and publishers used in manipulation for evidence.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Own the dialogue on major platforms: If Perplexity, Google AI Overviews or other high-impact sources are misrepresenting you, open communication with their editorial or partnership teams to correct the record.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Case examples (hypothetical but realistic)</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Company A noticed a slew of comparison pages positioning Competitor X as “expensive” and Company A as “the budget-friendly alternative.” The pages aggregated into Perplexity-style summaries and then showed up in ChatGPT answers. Company A responded by creating canonical comparison pages with clear data, securing coverage in trade outlets and hiring editors to clean up competitor pages on Wikipedia — within weeks their presence in AI-generated overviews shifted.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Startup B used AI-generated image assets and factory-generated review pages to create a network of “user stories” praising their product while subtly framing a market leader as “complex.” Because social feeds with AI images amplified these narratives, they began to surface in model outputs. Brands with deeper PR resources flagged the network and pushed for removals.</li>

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">The AI citation hustle creates thorny challenges across ethics, operations and legal risk. But it also invites creative defenses and policy responses.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Challenges</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Detection complexity: Unlike classic SEO spam, GEO operates across multiple data types (text, images, schema) and platforms (wikis, aggregators, social). Tracing a manipulation back to its source involves model behavior analysis, network mapping and forensic content attribution.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The AI-to-AI feedback loop: With <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark></mark> of AI Overview citations containing AI-generated content, you can get a self-sustaining narrative that’s hard to debunk because the evidence pointing to it is itself synthetic.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Resource asymmetry: Large brands or well-funded agencies can run large-scale manipulation campaigns; smaller brands may lack the resources to fight back.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Platform incentives: Companies that profit from engagement have mixed motives for policing manipulation. OpenAI’s subscription revenue (estimated at <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$2.7 billion">$2.7 billion</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$2.7 billion">$2.7 billion</mark></mark> annually and projected toward <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$4 billion">$4 billion</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="$4 billion">$4 billion</mark></mark> by end of 2025) creates implicit pressure to prioritize user experience and growth.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Regulatory gaps: Rules around training data transparency, AI provenance and platform liability are still nascent. Without clear regulations, manipulative behavior can thrive in gray areas.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Solutions and mitigations</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Invest in proactive monitoring: Build or subscribe to AI-aware monitoring that tracks how models describe your brand and where they pull citations from. This is the equivalent of modern brand monitoring.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Strengthen authoritative signals: Make your pages model-friendly: short summary paragraphs, clear structured data, factual citation-ready language and accessible references. If AI systems prefer concise, authoritative bites, give them those bites on YOUR pages.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Coordinate rapid editorial response: Monitor and respond to edits on major citation hubs. Recruit and train volunteers, PR teams and legal counsel to correct or challenge false narratives quickly.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Leverage trusted third parties: Independent journalism, analyst reports and academic citations are harder to synthesize at scale by manipulators. Investing in third-party validations can sink deeper roots into the citation graph.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Advocate for transparency and provenance: Push platforms and regulators for clearer provenance signals (labels showing when content is AI-generated), traceable training data lineage and easier reporting mechanisms for manipulated content.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Use legal channels when warranted: For coordinated defamatory campaigns, preservation letters, cease-and-desist notices and takedown requests may be necessary — particularly when manipulative campaigns cross into impersonation or false claims.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Ethical line: There’s a difference between SEO innovation and deception. Brands that play the hustle are taking reputational and regulatory risks. For defenders, the focus should be on transparency, speed and authoritative content.</p>

<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If platforms implement provenance labels and users learn to query multiple sources, skepticism might rise and manipulation will be harder. But if AI outputs remain opaque and profitable, public trust could remain high and manipulations will have outsized real-world effects.</li>

</ol>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Ultimately, the next three to five years will determine whether the AI citation hustle becomes an entrenched industry norm or a transient exploit curbed by better provenance, detection and policy. Given current adoption rates — with ChatGPT commanding significant market share and customer trust (<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="77.9%">77.9%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="77.9%">77.9%</mark></mark> of marketers favoring it among AI tools) — expect intensive jockeying for position.</p>

<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">The Great AI Citation Hustle is not a conspiracy theory; it’s a pragmatic response to new incentives. When a handful of AI agents become primary discovery tools for hundreds of millions of users, the desire to be cited, mentioned and framed favorably becomes a commercial imperative. The data is stark: Wikipedia makes up <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="16.3%">16.3%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="16.3%">16.3%</mark></mark> of ChatGPT citations, Perplexity <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="12.5%">12.5%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="12.5%">12.5%</mark></mark>, Google AI Overviews <mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="8.4%">8.4%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="8.4%">8.4%</mark></mark>, and an overwhelming share of AI Overview citations (<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="<mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark>"><mark class="statistic bg-yellow-100 text-gray-900 font-semibold px-1 rounded" data-value="91.4%">91.4%</mark></mark>) are drawn from AI-generated content. ChatGPT’s reach — hundreds of millions of users and ~37.5 million daily searches in 2024 — multiplies the impact of any manipulation. Meanwhile, tool vendors and agencies are packaging GEO as a service, and the content arms race is producing more AI-generated material and more opportunities for gaming systems.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">If you run a brand, your choices are clear: ignore it and risk being written out of AI-driven discovery; engage defensively and ethically to protect your reputation; or, if tempted, join the hustle and hope you don’t get burned by public backlash or regulatory action. The smartest strategy most likely blends all three defensive elements: proactive monitoring, authoritative content published with model-friendly structure, and rapid coordination with journalistic and platform partners.</p>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">Actionable takeaways</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Monitor AI outputs: Set up AI-aware alerts to track how ChatGPT and other agents mention your brand and competitors.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Harden authoritative channels: Keep Wikipedia, major profiles and industry glossaries accurate and up to date; use canonical, structured pages with clear summaries.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Publish model-ready content: Create concise, well-sourced FAQs, schema-marked pages and short summaries designed for retrieval systems.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Invest in trusted third-party validation: Prioritize independent coverage and analyst validation that are harder to manufacture.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Advocate for provenance: Demand clearer AI provenance, dataset transparency and easier reporting mechanisms from platforms.</li>
<li class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Build cross-functional response teams: Combine comms, legal, data and content talent to rapidly respond to manipulation attempts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-gray-700">This is a new kind of brand race — one fought on the circuitry of models rather than the SERPs alone. The hustlers will keep pushing, platforms will keep iterating, and regulators will follow. For those who care about how people discover and perceive their brand in 2025 and beyond, the question is no longer whether to <a href="/tools/content-optimizer" title="AI Content Optimization Tool" class="internal-link text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline decoration-blue-200 hover:decoration-blue-600">optimize for AI</a> — it’s how to do it without selling your integrity.</p>
