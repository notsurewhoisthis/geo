# Cloudflare DNS Fix Summary

## Issue Encountered
The Cloudflare MCP tools are experiencing display issues, returning `[object Object]` for all queries instead of readable output. This appears to be a serialization problem with the MCP server.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Error 530**: Origin DNS error indicates DNS records are pointing to incorrect targets
- **Required Fix**: Update CNAME records to point to correct Heroku DNS targets
- **Critical Requirement**: Disable Cloudflare proxy (set to DNS Only)

## Required Changes

### DNS Records Configuration
```
Record 1:
- Name: generative-engine.org (root domain)
- Type: CNAME  
- Content: endothelial-tickseed-ghfs1ljkfattred4hzt4my28.herokudns.com
- Proxied: false (DNS Only)

Record 2:
- Name: www.generative-engine.org
- Type: CNAME
- Content: polar-reindeer-y0g7jlud4jpcv07h7675juuy.herokudns.com  
- Proxied: false (DNS Only)
```

## Manual Resolution Path
Due to MCP tools being unavailable, manual configuration via Cloudflare dashboard is required:

1. Access Cloudflare dashboard
2. Select generative-engine.org zone
3. Navigate to DNS > Records
4. Update root domain CNAME record
5. Update www subdomain CNAME record  
6. Ensure both are set to "DNS Only" (not proxied)
7. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
8. Test both domains
